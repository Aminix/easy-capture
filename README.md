Get-Capture offers you a simple way to capture screenshots on your browser and edit them
.
You have different options for capturing:
- Select area: you can select the part of the window you want and when you are done, open the editor to play with it.
- Visible image: automatically take a pic of your view.
- Full image: capture an image of the whole page (now fully supported)
- Extract image: opens a new tab with the JPEG image so you can copy it, print it or download it if you don't feel like opening the editor.

The editor!
- Edit your images as you please, it has the basic editing options.
- It doesn't only works with images taken with Get-Capture, once you opened the editor you can press 'Ctrl+v' and paste any image you have on you clipboard! 
- Put it a name and download it.
- Or, if you need, print it.

Hope you enjoy it!
